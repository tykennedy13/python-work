# below is an example of indexing. the first item in any list has an index of ZERO
# and the next item is 1, followed by 2, etc.

# Note: Accessing values from something with square brackets [] in Python is called
# bracket notation. In the next lesson, lesson 2, you will see "dot notation".
print("The first student in the class class list is " + CLASS_LIST[0])

# in dictionaries, however, values can only be accessed by their key. The format to finding
# a key's value is `dictionary[key]`

print("Bronny's grade: " + str(GRADES_DICT["Bronny"]))

print("Denisa's grade: " + str(GRADES_DICT["Denisa"]))

# hm. so, the first student in class can be found using CLASS_LIST[0] . We can set that equal
# to a variable like this.

first_student = CLASS_LIST[0]

# now, since this student has a grade in the grades list, let's use this variable to find the
# value of their grade in the list!

first_student_grade = GRADES_DICT[first_student]

# lets print this out together in a readable way. Tip- when you combine strings with commas,
# a space is placed between the strings. However, when you use a `+` , there are no spaces added
